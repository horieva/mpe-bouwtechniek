## Floors and underfloor heating

### Here are a few key benefits of underfloor heating:

#### Uniform Heating:
Underfloor heating provides an even distribution of heat across the entire floor, offering a more comfortable environment compared to the uneven heat from traditional radiators.
 
#### Energy Efficiency: 
It operates at lower temperatures while delivering the same level of warmth, which makes it more energy efficient. This could lower your heating bills, reducing your environmental impact.
{{< image src="/img/services/underfloor.jpeg" portrait="true" class="rounded img-thumbnail float-end lana-right" >}}
#### Space Saving: 
Since the heating system is under the floor, it won't take up any wall space, which will leave more room for you to design your interiors as you wish.

#### Aesthetically Pleasing: 
Without the need for radiators, your rooms can have a cleaner, more minimalist design.
 
#### Safety and Comfort: 
There are no hot surfaces or sharp edges as with traditional radiators, making it a safer option, especially for households with children or elderly.

#### Less Air Circulation: 
Decreased air circulation reduces the movement of dust and allergens, beneficial for those with allergies or asthma.

#### Flexibility: 
Suitable for most types of floor covering including tile, wood, stone, and certain types of carpet, giving you diverse design options.

#### Sustainable: 
It can be used with renewable energy sources like solar or geothermal systems.

## Windows and doors

Advantages and disadvantages of three popular window materials: hardwood, aluminum, and plastic. Each material has its own unique characteristics, and understanding them will help you make an informed decision when choosing windows for your project.

### Hardwood Windows
__Advantages:__
1. Aesthetics: Hardwood windows offer a timeless and elegant appearance, enhancing the overall beauty of your space.
2. Insulation: Wood is a natural insulator, providing excellent thermal and acoustic performance, which helps in reducing energy consumption and noise pollution.
3. Durability: When properly maintained, hardwood windows can have a long lifespan, making them a sustainable choice.
4. Customization: Wood can be easily customized to match your desired style, shape, and size, allowing for greater design flexibility.

__Disadvantages:__
1. Maintenance: Hardwood windows require regular maintenance, including painting or staining, to protect them from moisture, insects, and UV damage.
2. Cost: Hardwood windows are generally more expensive than other materials due to the higher cost of raw materials and craftsmanship involved.

### Aluminum Windows
{{< image src="/img/services/windows.jpeg" portrait="true" class="rounded img-thumbnail float-end lana-right" >}}
__Advantages:__
1. Strength and Durability: Aluminum is a strong and robust material, providing excellent structural integrity and resistance to weather conditions.
2. Low Maintenance: Aluminum windows are virtually maintenance-free, as they do not require painting and are resistant to corrosion, rot, and pests.
3. Slim Profiles: Aluminum frames can offer sleek and slim designs, allowing for larger glass areas and maximizing natural light.
4. Recyclability: Aluminum is highly recyclable, making it an environmentally friendly choice.

__Disadvantages:__
1. Conductivity: Aluminum is a good conductor of heat and cold, which can impact energy efficiency if not properly insulated.
2. Condensation: Without thermal breaks, aluminum windows may be prone to condensation, leading to moisture-related issues.
3. Limited Color Options: While aluminum frames can be powder-coated in various colors, they offer fewer customization options compared to wood.

### Plastic Windows
__Advantages:__
1. Affordability: Plastic windows, such as uPVC (unplasticized polyvinyl chloride), are generally more budget-friendly than hardwood or aluminum options.
2. Low Maintenance: uPVC windows are easy to clean and require minimal upkeep as they do not warp, fade, or rot.
3. Energy Efficiency: Plastic windows can provide good insulation, reducing heat loss or gain and improving energy efficiency.
4. Moisture Resistance: Unlike wood, plastic windows are resistant to moisture, making them suitable for humid or coastal areas.

__Disadvantages:__
1. Aesthetics: Plastic windows may not offer the same visual appeal as hardwood or aluminum, as some people find the appearance less desirable.
2. Limited Lifespan: Plastic windows may have a shorter lifespan compared to hardwood or aluminum, as they can become brittle over time.
